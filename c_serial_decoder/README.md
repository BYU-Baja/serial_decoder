## Serial Decoder

Update, do not use this one unless you are very familiar with Linux and C compiling. There are a lot of things that you need to setup to get it to work. I would recommend using the python_decoder instead.

This project relies on the MQTT-C client https://github.com/LiamBindle/MQTT-C.git.

## Building

To build you must first clone the MQTT-C code in this repo. To do so run this command inside the root folder of this repo

'''git clone https://github.com/LiamBindle/MQTT-C.git mqtt'''
